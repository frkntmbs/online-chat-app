# Real-Time Socket Communication in a Single Project with SocketIO + Next.js + Tailwind + Zustand

This project is developed using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Zustand to facilitate real-time communication with SocketIO. By leveraging Next.js's custom server, the need for a separate project for SocketIO is eliminated, allowing all functionalities to be contained within a single project.
